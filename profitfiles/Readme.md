First Fac(just the first builded factory)[The one you need to build but just need one, don't need more than one when build more fac(jusu one/can more than one)]
<all facilities need>(when in 100% speed)
<total lands need>
<profit/land used>(pre land)

--
<by-products profit>(pre second)(if it have by-product(s))
--
(Haven't the total profit and total by-products' profit, if you want it, calculate it by yourself)
Asset+(In First Fac(each level of factory(0.5%/level)))
(<profit/fac in First Fac>(per fac))(If more than one fac)
<profit/land used>(pre land)(more)
(Follow the chance b, it will show the profit haven't minus the asset profit)
