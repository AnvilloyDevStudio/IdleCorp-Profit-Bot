# IdleCorp Profit Bot

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is no longer active.

This is a bot under the IdleCorp Profit project, providing general supports for playing IdleCorp.

This project has not been updated since I published the version 1.3.0 of this bot before I decided to publish this.

If there is anyone interested in this project, you may either make a fork/copy and start from the code or
reach out me for the collaboration of this project where I will see if it is a good idea. At the moment, I decided not to continue
work on this project due to the time cost and availability. There is also a reason that I no longer played this game.
So, I may archive this project later, including the corresponding repositories.

## History

Originally, this project started by txt files before there is a Discord bot. Then,
after a few updates on the files, the first version of the bot came out, it was
written in Python.

## Note

By 2024/09/14 (UTC), the commits are edited so that a password is hidden for serious security,
but the bot tokens have been invalidated. bit.io is not longer used since 1.3.0,
so the exposure should be safe enough. (It is now also discontinued.) Still, this project is in a mess, but
this should be enough for code publishing.
