# IdleCorp Profit Bot

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is no longer active.

This is a bot under the IdleCorp Profit project, providing general supports for playing IdleCorp.

This project has not been updated since I published the version 1.3.0 of this bot before I decided to publish this.

## Note

By 2024/09/14 (UTC), the commits are edited so that a password is hidden for serious security,
but the bot tokens have been invalidated. bit.io is not longer used since 1.3.0,
so the exposure should be safe enough. Still, this project is in a mess, but
this should be enough for code publishing.
