# IdleCorp Profit Bot

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is no longer active.
> For the details, you may read the below.

## Information

This is a bot under the IdleCorp Profit project, providing general supports for playing IdleCorp.

For some more information, you may head to [the Google Site](https://sites.google.com/view/idlecorpprofit).

There are also some files stored in [another repository](https://github.com/AnvilloyDevStudio/IdleCorp-Profit-project).

## Current State & Future

This project has not been updated since I published the version 1.3.0 of this bot before I decided to publish this.

If there is anyone interested in this project, you may either make a fork/copy and start from the code or
reach out me for the collaboration of this project where I will see if it is a good idea. At the moment, I decided not to continue
work on this project due to the time cost and availability. There is also a reason that I no longer played this game.
So, I may archive this project later, including the corresponding repositories.

However, it is possible to create an organization for this project with people who are interested in participating this
IdleCorp Profit project, although it still needs a group of people of the players first.

At the moment, the Python and the Lite versions are archived. The Python one is pretty old, and the Lite one is
still written in JavaScript but not TypeScript. Still, this version has already covered the functionalities
implemented in either versions. You may still try to run if you like to, but for this version, you may need
some fixes as this relies on a database for some server-related or region-related functions.

I am not running any of them right now as I have already deleted the server, nor in the future.
I would not like run it even I have got a new server again in the future, as I am not working on
this project anymore. And again, I am welcome to anyone who is interested in this as a player
of IdleCorp, picking up this project.

Still, this project is in a mess, but this should be enough for code publishing.
My coding ability and practices are growing and developing along the time, so
there can be a lot of unorganized and confusing blocks in the code, especially the Python one.

I had not planned to publish these code to public originally, so I just included the passwords
without thinking, but a kind of mistake. Then I had to amend the commits to remove the dangerous
password, the one I used in a lot of places. (A bad practice I know, and I am just not willing to
make it too troublesome, but well, convenience can bring to risk.) I never used any
version control system at that time, so the commit history is incomplete as intended.

## History

Originally, this project started by txt files (on HQ Discord in 2020 Dec; released in RAR) before there
is a Discord bot. Then, after a few updates on the files, the first version of the bot came out, it was
written in Python. This is almost the start of my this programming life, started with Python. I started
coding it in around 2021 Jan, as well as the Discord server.

Since v1.1.0 (in 2021 Jul), the code has been migrated to discord.js (JavaScript) from discord.py
when I discovered the botherness of using Python and the convenience of JavaScript over it. In fact,
it can be because I have made this more advanced.

Since v1.3.0 (in 2022 Apr), which is the last version, the code has been migrated to TypeScript from
JavaScript. Again, it can be because I have cared more about code and data safety along with my
growth of programming skills.

Roughly, this is what major chganes came in the bot code. Other than this, the Lite version has started
being worked on at the end of 2021 Nov, with it working since 2021 Dec. This bot has also been made as
a server bot not only providing profit calculations but also server utilities, so it is limited to
just the server. Then, the invitable Lite version is made to solve this issue, which does not contain
any server utility functions. However, it can be a heavier workload to maintain both code at the same
time.

When v1.3.0 was released, I had already turned my sight forward the Minicraft+ project. Accordingly,
I had no more time and energy continuing working on both the main and the Lite versions. Then, the bots
are as well continuing dying out, by the unmaintanence of code and deletion of server on 18 Sep, 2022.
Thus, the end of life of service since then.

Along the time, mostly of time the only access to the bot is by the project Discord server before the
announcement of the Lite version. So, when there are really a few people in the server, really a few
people have used the bot. Obviously, the use of the bot is indeed low, and thus unvaluable for continuation of
maintanence.

## Acknowledgement

**Teemaw**, a great gratitude, for developing and hosting such a good game bot, IdleCorp, fun to play, and
also leading me to start this my first long code project.

Server members, for showing supports and engagement for the development of both the project and the bots.

IdleCorp players, for playing the game, inspiring me of starting this project.
